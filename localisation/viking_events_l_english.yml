 hellenic_events.101.d: "It is Hetairideia, a festival dedicated to our supreme god of sky. With the statue of Zeus carried, the celebrating people paraded down the main streets of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. When they finally reach the destination, a sumptuous feast is about to be held. Zeus is formally invited and his seat is arranged at the most honorable part of the table. 'Praise Zeus!' shouting and cheering the people."
 hellenic_events.14.t: "Election of Pontifex Maximus"
 hellenic_events.14.d: "All priests of the Hellenic faith gather here in Roma participating in the election of Pontifex Maximus. You know the result is guaranteed, still this may be a good chance to improve our prestige and show the world our strength."
 hellenic_events.14.a: "Sumptuous celebration will be held once the result comes out."
 hellenic_events.14.b: "So be it."
 hellenic_events.14.c: "No need to be extravagant."
 hellenic_events.15.d: "The successful implementation of our recent reforms has resulted in some distress, both among the nobles and among the Huaca-worshippers in the countryside, who feel left behind. They feel we are abandoning the ancient customs of both ours, and their forefathers and fear that this development will decrease their power and influence.\nThese dissenters have now joined forces with one of the influential Panaca lineages to put a candidate of their own on the throne."
 hellenic_events.15.a: "They will regret this."
 hellenic_events.101.a: "All glory to Zeus!"
 hellenic_events.101.b: "The almightiness of Zeus has given me inspirations."
 hellenic_events.102.t: "Inspirations of Zeus"
 hellenic_events.102.d: "After contemplation and learning over a long time, you feel like you have a deeper understanding of the almightiness of Zeus."
 hellenic_events.102.a: "It is his domination over all other gods makes Zeus almighty."
 hellenic_events.102.b: "It is the power of thunder makes Zeus almighty."
 hellenic_events.103.t: "Daedala"
 hellenic_events.103.d: "The festival of Daedala begins today. Women in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] gathered at the temple of Poseidon early this morning, wearing their hair loose and leaving not a single knot in their robes. The ritual soon begins, a white lamb and a small calf are sacrificed at the altar, sanctity of marriage, birth of new lives, and peace are prayed for. At home, husbands and children are ready to shower their wives and mothers with gifts."
 hellenic_events.103.a: "May Poseidon bless us all!"
 hellenic_events.103.b: "The aspects of being wife, mother and queen simultaneously has given me inspirations."
 hellenic_events.104.t: "Inspirations of Poseidon"
 hellenic_events.104.d: "You discussed with scholars and theologians about the importance of the bonds of marriage, the harmony of family life, and the role they play in maintaining a peaceful diplomatic relationship. Now you have a better understanding of your faith."
 hellenic_events.104.a: "Poseidon revealed how can different nations unite as one."
 hellenic_events.104.b: "Poseidon revealed how to balance domestic affairs."
 hellenic_events.105.t: "Sacrifice to Ares"
 hellenic_events.105.d: "Our brave soldiers are assembled at the square before the temple of Ares, waiting for the ritual to begin. The priests walk out of the temple and stand before the altar. The Sacrifice to Ares begins, sacrifices are made, trumpets are sounded. Soldiers and their weapons and armors are purified. This marks the end of last summer campaign season until the new one begins the next spring."
 hellenic_events.105.a: "A glorious procession will be held."
 hellenic_events.105.b: "I'm curious why a festival about peace is held in honor of Ares, the god of war."
 hellenic_events.106.t: "Inspirations of Ares"
 hellenic_events.106.d: "You spent a long time contemplating and learning, yet still feel clueless about the secret of the festival of Sacrifice to Ares."
 hellenic_events.106.a: "At least we should not attack the enemy in winter."
 hellenic_events.107.t: "Plynteria"
 hellenic_events.107.d: "Plynteria, the festival dedicated to Athena, our virgin goddess of wisdom, begins today. It is celebrated not only by those who worship her as their patron deity, such as scholars, doctors, and artisans. It is a festival enjoyed by everyone. New plays choose to debut on this day, and theaters are full of people early in the morning. Contests of oration and poetry are held before the temple of Athena, winners are crowned with a laurel wreath. The celebration will last for five days."
 hellenic_events.107.a: "Wisdom is power!"
 hellenic_events.107.b: "Which one is more important for a good monarch, wisdom or force?"
 hellenic_events.108.t: "Inspirations of Athena"
 hellenic_events.108.d: "You have been thinking about the way of being a good ruler for a long time, and feel like you have found your answer."
 hellenic_events.108.a: "A good ruler always use [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wisdom."
 hellenic_events.108.b: "A good ruler knows when to use the force."
 hellenic_events.109.t: "Hermaea"
 hellenic_events.109.d: "'All those who make a living trading their wares, offer you incense, and beg you to swell their profits.' thus wrote Ovid. Hermaea, a festival dedicated to Hermes begins. Merchants from all over the city and from near areas have all gathered before the temple of Hermes in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. After offering a sacrifice to the protector of commerce, they draw water from the fountain near the temple and then sprinkle their goods and hair with a laurel bough and pray for good luck."
 hellenic_events.109.a: "A golden key can open any door!"
 hellenic_events.109.b: "Hmm, it is interesting that a god of commerce is also the protector of thieves."
 hellenic_events.110.t: "Inspirations of Hermes"
 hellenic_events.110.d: "You went to a local market recently, a place under protection of Hermes. You found traders trying to cheat their customers. 'Catch the thief!' cried a woman, you squinted in the direction of the voice and saw a boy running with a gold necklace in his hand. 'Smart boy, how could he steal a necklace when its owner is wearing it?' you said to yourself."
 hellenic_events.110.a: "At least trickery can make us rich!"
 hellenic_events.111.t: "Adonia"
 hellenic_events.111.d: "'Aphrodite, you changer of hearts. We shall perform your rites. May your blessing be on us.' the priestesses complete the prayer and the ritual of Adonia begins. Female attendants of the goddess, chosen from all women in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], undress the statue and wash it ceremonially with warm water. Once the statue is dry, fresh flowers are offered and it is garlanded with myrtle. And then the statue is carried out of her temple, the celebrating begin."
 hellenic_events.111.a: "Aphrodite blesses those who love her!"
 hellenic_events.111.b: "The grumpy are pacified, anger turned into joy. What is the secret of such power of Aphrodite?"
 hellenic_events.112.t: "Inspirations of Aphrodite"
 hellenic_events.112.d: "You talked with wise men and read ancient stories, you feel like you have found the reason. The Romans regarded Aphrodite as their divine mother and Ares as divine father, and the glory of the empire was thus built upon the combination of love and war."
 hellenic_events.112.a: "A wise ruler uses [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] love wisely."
 hellenic_events.113.t: "Crisis of Faith"
 hellenic_events.113.d: "You acted cynically toward your patron god but didn't get punished, you prayed and received no reply. You feel like you have lost faith in your god while the priests told it is just a crisis of faith that everyone will experience. Maybe I have been praying to the wrong one and it is time to change?"
 hellenic_events.113.a: "It is a test of gods which I shall pass."
 hellenic_events.113.b: "Zeus is the supreme god."
 hellenic_events.113.c: "I follow Poseidon, peace and harmony will be blessed upon us."
 hellenic_events.113.e: "Ares will lead us to victory."
 hellenic_events.113.f: "I follow Athena in way of wisdom."
 hellenic_events.113.g: "We will gain our prosperity from Hermes."
 hellenic_events.113.h: "I worship Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty."
 bendtheknee: "Bend the knee"
 bendtheknee.1.t: "The Waldensian Question"
 bendtheknee.1.d: "His Holiness the Pope has asked us if we would consider changing our ways and agreeing to look back at Catholicism, and see if we would come back into the fold of the Pope. We can either stick to our Waldensian roots, or we can sway on the side of Catholicism and the Pope."
 bendtheknee.1.a: "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy ghost, We are Waldensian!"
 bendtheknee.1.b: "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy ghost, We shall be Catholic!"
 bendtheknee.2.t: "The Lollard Question"
 bendtheknee.2.d: "His Holiness the Pope has asked us if we would consider changing our ways and agreeing to look back at Catholicism, and see if we would come back into the fold of the Pope. We can either stick to our Lollard roots, or we can sway on the side of Catholicism and the Pope."
 bendtheknee.2.a: "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy ghost, We are Lollard!"
 bendtheknee.2b: "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy ghost, We shall be Catholic!"
 bendtheknee.3.t: "The Fraticelli Question"
 bendtheknee.3.d: "His Holiness the Fraticelli Pope of Urbino has asked us if we would consider changing our ways and agreeing to look at Fraticelli, and see if we would come into the fold of the new Pope. They believe in similar aspects of Catholicism, but instead of the Catholic greed, they believe in being chaste and temperate. We can either stick to our Catholic roots, or we can sway on the side of the Fraticelli and the Fraticelli Pope."
 bendtheknee.3.a: "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy ghost, We are Fraticelli!"
 bendtheknee.3.b: "In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy ghost, We shall remain Catholic!"
 lollard_events.1.t: "The Display of Royal Arms"
 lollard_events.1.d: "Following the destruction and removal of Papist symbols, Lollard churches were left somewhat bare of decoration. It has been decreed that in place of these blasphemous icons, the Royal Arms of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to be displayed. The presence of the Royal Arms cements in the public consciousness the reality of the new order; that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is appointed by God not only as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of $COUNTRY$, but also as Supreme Governor of the Church."
 lollard_events.1.a: "Display the Royal Arms proudly in every church."
 lollard_events.2.t: "Recusancy"
 lollard_events.2.d: "Attending Lollard services is mandatory in the [Root.GovernmentName] of $COUNTRY$. Recusancy is punishable by harsh fines. A person found guilty must forfeit all their goods and chattels, their lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all of their rents and annuities. Enforcement, however, is difficult due to the sheer number of potential recusants, and so we should focus our efforts on the most concerning offenders.\n\nPopery is a particularly heinous crime. As the Pope denies the legitimacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], so too must faithful Catholics, and thus all Catholics may be considered traitors to the state.\n\nRadical nonconformists such as the Puritans may also be targeted by these laws should they stray too far from the established doctrines of the Church.\n\nThe law enforces the uniformity of religious belief in $COUNTRY$, but it might also be used to discourage factionalism within the court. The mere suggestion of recusancy can destroy one’s reputation at court."
 lollard_events.2.a: "Target Catholics."
 lollard_events.2.b: "Target Puritans."
 lollard_events.2.c: "Target political threats."
 lollard_events.3.t: "Prophesying and Sermons"
 lollard_events.3.d: "The Lollard Church does not require that its clergy devote much time to preaching. A monthly or even quarterly sermon is adequate according to the law, which is usually lifted directly from the Book of Homilies.\n\nMany parishioners desire a more personal and involved approach to religious services, and have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to pay for educated lecturers to preach in their towns. These lecturers however do not always have the most orthodox of theological views. It is often the case that the most eager to preach are those with the most radical ideas, and so these private sermons have become associated with the Puritan movement.\n\nWhile there are advantages to a more religiously literate populace, cracking down on Puritanism would increase the authority of the Church."
 lollard_events.3.a: "Ban these nonconformist sermons."
 lollard_events.3.b: "Let them preach as they wish."
 lollard_events.4.t: "Parliamentary Debate on Doctrine"
 lollard_events.4.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GetParliamentName] is often called upon to debate matters of religion. Typically, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will propose a new wave of reforms for the Lollard Church and [Root.GetParliamentWithGrammer] will take a stance along established factional lines; the Members in the Commons more likely to support radical or even Puritan measures, the Lords temporal more likely to favour a more conservative approach. Rarely does the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] get [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way precisely, and when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does, coercive measures are often involved."
 lollard_events.4.a: "Pass the reforms exactly as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proposed."
 lollard_events.4.b: "The Lords win the day."
 lollard_events.4.c: "The Commons have their way."
 lollard_events.5.t: "The Marprelate Tracts"
 lollard_events.5.d: "Dissatisfied with the conservative establishment of the Lollard Church, a group of Puritans writing under the pseudonym ‘Martin Marprelate’ began publishing a series of scathing pamphlets directed at the Church leadership. The Bishops of $COUNTRY$, according to these writers, are ‘proud, popish, presumptuous, profane, paltry, pestilent and pernicious prelates’ who usurp authority from God.\n\nThese tracts have garnered public attention and risk making a mockery of the Establishment lest something be done about them."
 lollard_events.5.a: "Ignore this nonsense."
 lollard_events.5.b: "Respond in kind, this is a war of pamphlets!"
 lollard_events.5.c: "Find and arrest the authors."
 lollard_events.6.t: "Prayer Book Rebellions"
 lollard_events.6.d: "The doctrines of the Lollard Church are contained within the Book of Common Prayer. It is a book that needs periodic revisions to accord with changes in Lollard thought, as it shifts between more radical and more traditional theology. The most recent edition contains material that has greatly angered the people of [prayer_book_province.GetName], many of whom still cling to Catholic dogmas and practices. They have risen up in revolt, demanding that the Book be reverted to its previous edition."
 lollard_events.6.a: "Repeal the new edition and make traditionalist concessions."
 lollard_events.6.b: "We will not tolerate papist treason!"
 lollard_events.7.t: "Crypto-Catholic Statesman"
 lollard_events.7.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Reformation did not sway the hearts and minds of the entire population. Many continue to harbour Catholic sympathies, even among the court. It has been discovered that $STATESMAN$ has been secretly attending a Catholic Mass, a practice strictly forbidden by law. If exposed, [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] stands to lose all of [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] land and property, and will no longer be eligible for public office."
 lollard_events.7.a: "They're too useful, for now."
 lollard_events.7.b: "No Catholics in my court!"
 lollard_events.7.c: "Off with his head!"
 lollard_events.8.t: "Prayers to Saints"
 lollard_events.8.d: "When $COUNTRY$ broke with Rome, we did away with the superstitious notion that prayers should be directed to the Saints rather than to God himself. As our new theology has no place for the papist concept of Purgatory, there is no need for Saints to intercede on behalf of our souls. Despite this, many people continue the practice of praying to Saints, and many churches give excessive reverence to their patron."
 lollard_events.8.a: "It's harmless, we can allow this."
 lollard_events.8.b: "Uniformity must be enforced"
 lollard_events.9.t: "Abolition of Feast Days"
 lollard_events.9.d: "The Catholic liturgical calendar is filled with feast days that function as public holidays and occasions for celebration. No longer under Papal authority, our own Church must decide how far this practice ought to continue. Those most fervent reformers argue that superfluous holidays encourage sinful temptation and distract from gainful labor. This has been met with broad agreement in terms of theology, but abolishing feast days is likely to upset the populace who do so enjoy the occasional day off."
 lollard_events.9.a: "Abolish more feast days."
 lollard_events.9.b: "Let them have their fun."
 lollard_events.10.t: "Puritans Leaving for the Colonies"
 lollard_events.10.d: "The Puritans have for some time criticized the hierarchy and doctrines of the Church of $COUNTRY$. The Reformation has to their eyes merely replaced the Pope with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they openly denounce the state’s slothful attitude to reform. Theological disputes aside, Puritans have also been persecuted as nonconformists, depending on the leanings of the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Finally exhausted by the religious affairs of Europe, many Puritans have decided to migrate in the New World. They have organized themselves into a colonial company an requested a charter to establish new settlements in the Americas."
 lollard_events.10.b: "Integrate them into an established colony."
 lollard_events.10.a: "Let them build their own settlement."
 lollard_events.11.t: "Controversy over Vestments"
 lollard_events.11.d: "The matter of clerical vestments remains a contentious issue in the Lollard Church. The extravagant and superstitious rags of the papists are surely to be done away with, but the degree of austerity required of the clergy continues to inflame debate and protest.\n\nConservative Lollards wish to reinstate some of the elaborate trappings of the old Catholic priesthood, while moderates argue that a simple surplice is sufficient. Radical reformers insist that vestments are not merely lacking scriptural support, but deface and corrupt the ordinances which God has instituted."
 lollard_events.11.a: "Allow traditional vestments."
 lollard_events.11.b: "Surplices only."
 lollard_events.11.c: "Denounce all vestments."
 lollard_events.12.t: "Smashing Altars"
 lollard_events.12.d: "The early years of the English Reformation are a time of fervent iconoclasm. Any adornment or relic that even suggests Papism, the existence of Purgatory, or the divinity of saints is being ruthlessly stripped from the churches. Anything that could lead the laity astray must be destroyed; altars are smashed, paintings painted over, shrines ruined.\n\nA perpetual issue for the new Lollard Church is the matter of how far this iconoclasm should be taken. Some more radical reformers push for an end to roods, candlesticks, and crucifixes, while others seek the restoration of some of the more harmless ornaments."
 lollard_events.12.a: "Smash the altars and imprison papist protesters!"
 lollard_events.12.b: "Destroy only what is undeniably papist."
 lollard_events.12.c: "Put an end to this iconoclasm."
 lollard_events.13.t: "Catholic Instigators"
 lollard_events.13.d: "Though $COUNTRY$ has formally split from the Rome, the Pope continues to meddle in our affairs by orchestrating plots against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Jesuits and priests number among his agents, sheltered by traitorous recusants.\n\nThese crypto-Catholics employ cunning methods of hiding Papist agents from the law, deviously building secret areas behind walls, under the floorboards, and even in concealed underground passageways. Hiding in these 'priest holes' can injure or even suffocate their occupants, so they are at least unlikely to be able to make a quick escape once located."
 lollard_events.13.a: "Conduct a national priest-hunt. Search every house!"
 lollard_events.13.b: "Find out where they're coming from"
 lollard_events.14.t: "The Church of $COUNTRY$"
 lollard_events.14.d: "As the Protestant Reformation radically shifts the religious landscape of Europe, $COUNTRY$ must take a firm stance on its faith. This has of course provoked much discussion in court, with some favoring the Protestant cause and others defending the traditional religion.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of Church. A Church with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as its Supreme Governor, a happy union of Church and state. Neither Protestant, Catholic, nor Reformed, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a Church would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could marry and divorce at will, determine the nation’s theological direction, and have the assurance that they are appointed to rule directly by God."
 lollard_events.15.t: "Nonconformist Monarch"
 lollard_events.15.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has landed in the unenviable position of being both a religious nonconformist and the Supreme Governor of the Church of $COUNTRY$. The Lollards of $COUNTRY$ struggle to tolerate this state of affairs, and the legitimacy of the Church is dramatically weakened."
 lollard_events.15.a: "This will be a difficult adjustment."
 lollard_events.15.b: "The monarch must be Lollard."
 england_dynasty.1.t: "Plots of Assassination"
 england_dynasty.1.desc: "The houses of Tudor, York and Plantagenet have all decided that now we have unified the throne, we must give up the crown to one of them as they are the strongest of noble houses. In the run up to unifying England, we have already had narrow escapes from assassination attempts. If we deny their request, they will no doubt rise up with forces larger than we are able to muster, so whilst we have unified the Kingdom of England, we are not strong enough to lead it. Now is the time to pick a successor."

 monastic_order.77.d: "As a monastic order much of our knightly forces are filled up by second sons of noble houses, pious veterans, but also of soldiers and captains looking to serve the faith during times of peace and prosperity."
 monastic_order.77.a: "Excellent, more warriors to serve the lord."
 monastic_order.79.t: "Lack of Piety"
 monastic_order.79.d: "It appears our monastic order has had a major influx of new recruits, yet many knights seem more interested in aquiring wealth and fame rather then defending the faith."
 monastic_order.79.a: "Let us purge our order of inpurity."
 monastic_order.79.b: "As long as they serve the lord, minor infractions can be forgiven."
 monastic_order.80.t: "Militarize the Order"
 monastic_order.80.d: "We are the descendants of centuries of holy warriors, brave crusaders and pious heroes. Let us not go quietly into the good night and give up our purpose, Let our monastic order remain pure and devoted to the lord, and not fall to decadence and a life of administration and rulership."
 monastic_order.80.a: "Poor landless crusaders we were, and so shall we remain."
 monastic_order.80.b: "We have to adapt to the modern times, the age of landless crusaders is over."

 internal_mission.81.a: "Ave Maria."
 internal_mission.82.t: "Failure of Duty"
 internal_mission.82.d: "Our internal mission has been to protect our flock and have them spread across the lands, however, it seems we have failed in our duty. Huge numbers of heretics and heathens are running amock, damaging the belief people have in our capacity to protect them."
 internal_mission.82.a: "We have to restore the trust of the people."
 external_mission.83.t: "Deus Vult"
 external_mission.83.d: "Our external mission has been to spread the faith to the heretics beyond our borders, right now we are in a fatal struggle with the faithless. Let us rally our people for a heroic holy war!"
 external_mission.83.a: "Deus Vult."
 external_mission.84.t: "Sins of the Human Heart"
 external_mission.84.d: "The external mission has led us to pursue a highly militaristic and ruthless foreign and domestic policy. This has led to some of our troops invading a border town and massacring the inhabitants. Even though they were faithfull members of our state."
 external_mission.84.a: "What... What have we become."
 external_mission.84.b: "Blame the attack on bandits."
 holy_sites.85.t: "Wave of Piety"

 expel_heathens.88.t: "Eminent Domain"
 expel_heathens.88.d: "A decline in the amount of expelled heathens has led to less land then usual being available for settlement by pious immigrants, To alleviate this we could either send them back to their place of origin or seize some of the land of our clergy and nobility to make space for the potential citizens."

 combat_heresy.89.b: "I have nothing to fear."
 combat_heresy.90.t: "Reign of Terror"
 combat_heresy.90.d: "As a unexpected side effect of our divine cause of combatting heresy, our peasants and merchant are fearful of acting in a way that can be interpreted as heretical.

 holy_orthodoxy.91.t: "New Edition"

 holy_orthodoxy.92.t: "Conflict of Opinion"
 holy_orthodoxy.92.d: "Even within our holy orthodoxy it appears there are multiple opinions on what exactly is meant with interpretations of the Lord's word. The noble estate claims that the primary role of protecting the faithfull falls to their swords, the clergy claims the primary role of protecting the faithfull falls to their prayer."
 holy_orthodoxy.92.a: "What good are swords against the terrors of the heart?"
 holy_orthodoxy.92.b: "The knights shall provide a bulwork against fear and despair."

 religious_pragmatism.96.t: "Grassroots inquisition"
 religious_pragmatism.96.d: "Our religious pragmatism has led to the establishment of small heretic and heathen communities, which we kindly tolerate. Some of our local nobles don't take to kindly to what they percieve to be new strongholds that are more loyal to the ruler then to their local Lords, and demand the communities disarm."

 religious_pragmatism.96.b: "Guarentee their rights."

But still, we believe we can reach further, can we not? There is always more ways to be devoted, and an ever expanding variety of methods to show devotion whilst also adhering to the sacred texts and holy laws of our land."

 bishops_law.101.t: "Inspirational Rule"
 bishops_law.101.d: "The empowered governance of our Bishop inspires the faithful. His justice has spread across the land, bringing an end to many conflicts and injustices across the land. For political gain we could claim this is the bishop's work instead of the Lord's justice."
 bishops_law.101.a: "This is the result of piety and the word of God."
 bishops_law.101.b: "$RULERNAME$ is the true architect of this."
 bishops_law.102.t: "Nobody else to blame"
 bishops_law.102.d: "With our faith placed firmly in the Bishop, he is given not only praise for the things he does well - but blame for when things go poorly.  His rule has been poor lately, and shifting the blame somewhere else would be difficult."
 bishops_law.102.a: "Admit to your mistakes."
 bishops_law.102.b: "Desperately shift the blame." 
 peasants_estate_events.1.t: "Representation Pays Off"
 peasants_estate_events.1.d: "The representation of the peasants as a well represented estate has caused their spirits to rise and in return they are willing to back whatever we want."
 peasants_estate_events.1.a: "Excellent."
 peasants_estate_events.2.t: "Peasants Rally"
 peasants_estate_events.2.d: "The war has taken a heavy toll on our nation, but the fact that the peasants have their concerns heard and treated means that they will fight to retain their rights."
 peasants_estate_events.2.a: "For freedom!"
 peasants_estate_events.3.t: "Peasant Petition"
 peasants_estate_events.3.d: "The peasants have petitioned us to grant them some more liberty to locally solve issues and determine their own building and production regulations."

 peasants_estate_events.4.a: "Appoint him to the royal domain." 
 peasants_estate_events.4.b: "Give him the funds to spread it to the villages!"
 peasants_estate_events.5.t: "Peasants Expand into Crown Lands"

 jewish_events.1.t: "Simon of [GetCapitalName]"
 jewish_events.1.d: "Early last month, a Christian toddler in [GetCapitalName] disappeared without a trace. A city-wide search was conducted and his body turned up after several days in an irrigation ditch by the house of a prominent Jewish citizen. The age-old accusation of ritual murder - the idea that Jews use the blood of Christian children to bake their matzah and torment the children in mockery of Ieshua's crucifixion - was brought against the homeowner's entire family, and a local Christian mob took them into custody, forcing confessions out of them.\nThe story of Simon's supposed 'murder' by Jews has spread rapidly via Christian traders and itinerants, who have turned it into something of a pan-European scandal. Mobs of angry Christians across the region have been attacking and even massacring Jewish communities in their furor, while Europe's monarchs are demanding the child's immediate canonization."
 jewish_events.1.a: "We must intervene however we can!"
 jewish_events.1.b: "Invite Jews to our lands for protection" 
 jewish_events.2.t: "The [jewish_massacre_province.GetName] Massacre"
 jewish_events.2.d: "Despite our best efforts to protect our own population, these continuing tensions over Simon's death have spurred a pogrom in [jewish_massacre_province.GetName], where Christians had been supplied surreptitiously with arms. They broke into a Jewish congregation and began to massacre everyone they could find, killing perhaps hundreds before the authorities could impose order once again. Their violence may only embolden other angry Christians in our realm to attack their neighbors, and vice versa."
 jewish_events.2.a: "Execute everyone involved, it's only fair"
 jewish_events.2.b: "Imprison the ringleaders and try to ease tensions" 
 jewish_events.3.t: "The Papal Inquisition"
 jewish_events.3.d: "The unrest over Simon's supposed murder has become so severe that Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] himself has intervened, sending an official legate, Battista dei Giudici, to personally investigate the matter. Giudici has been continually thwarted by the local Christian authorities, however, and has even been accused of being a secret Jewish agent himself.\nAny day now the Holy Father will announce his decision on the legality of the murder trial by promulgating a Papal Bull."
 jewish_events.3.a: "Who cares what that old fool says?"
 jewish_events.3.b: "Let us hope the Bull at least gives no clear verdict"
 jewish_events.3.c: "Let us pray the Bull exonerates Jews!"
 jewish_events.4.t: "Our Lachrymose History"
 jewish_events.4.d: "Some contend that the history of the Jewish people is a history of endless suffering and tribulations, and this recent ongoing pogrom seems to be a confirmation. Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has added fuel to the flames by not only praising the kangaroo court that blamed the local Jews, but making this conviction the official viewpoint of the Catholic Church in new Bull. It is clear that we cannot rely on any Christian authority figure to protect us and must do what we can to protect ourselves."
 jewish_events.4.a: "We will always keep our heads raised"
 jewish_events.5.t: "An Uneasy Resolution"
 jewish_events.5.d: "With so much propaganda and obfuscation swirling around the Simon mystery, it is likely we will never know the true story of his death. Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has indeed declared that while the investigation was carried out lawfully, no verdict can be made with confidence, and has furthermore reconfirmed Pope Innocent IV's past Bull committing to the defense of European Jews and condemning mob trials. It seems this wave of pogroms is starting to die down."
 jewish_events.5.a: "Things will continue on"
 jewish_events.6.t: "Blood Libel Cleared"
 jewish_events.6.d: "Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName], perhaps swayed by our efforts to contain this latest bout of attacks against Europe's Jews, has ruled that the 'investigation' into Simon's death was carried out unlawfully and the guilt of the blamed local Jews was not adequately established. With even prominent Christian figures on our side, it will be difficult for the angered mobs to continue to justify their current wave of persecutions."
 jewish_events.6.a: "Wonderful!"
 jewish_events.7.t: "Cum Nimis Absurdum"
 jewish_events.7.d: "The head of the Catholic Church, Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName], has just betrayed centuries of Papal policy committing to protecting Jews in a newly-issued Bull titled 'Cum Nimis Absurdum'.\n'It is completely absurd', the Bull begins, 'that Jews be allowed to live with us', going on to explain that Jews condemned themselves to eternal slavery by rejecting Ieshua's Messianic claims. The Bull establishes new provisions for Jews to be confined to a particular quarter of each Christian city called a 'ghetto', from the Venetian word for 'foundry'.\nJews are to be locked in their ghetto every night, and among other disgraces will be forced to attend Christian sermons on the Shabbat and to wear identifying clothes at all times. This is nothing short of an all-out war against Europe's Jewish community."
 jewish_events.7.a: "Send letters of protest"
 jewish_events.7.b: "It looks like this is the new normal" 
 jewish_events.8.t: "The [jewish_ghetto_province.GetCapitalName] Ghetto"
 jewish_events.8.d: "In accordance with the Pope's commandment, Christians in [jewish_ghetto_province.GetCapitalName] have tried to organize to establish a Ghetto formally separating the city's Jews from its Christians. Understandably, many Jews find this provision ridiculous and want to fight back against it. They look to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for help in shutting down the Christians' outrageous scheme."
 jewish_events.8.a: "Tell them to refuse!"
 jewish_events.8.b: "We cannot risk a conflict with Christianity" 
 jewish_events.8.c: "Maybe this will inadvertently protect us?" 
 jewish_events.9.t: "Caps and Kerchiefs"
 jewish_events.9.d: "An important part of the provisions in Cum Nimis Absurdum is the barring of all Jews from practicing any job that poses a risk to Christian health, such as practicing medicine or selling food. To ensure this and other segregationist policies can be enforced, Jews are now required to wear identifying marks in public - a yellow cap for men, and a yellow kerchief for women."
 jewish_events.9.a: "The only absurdity here is these commandments"
 jewish_events.9.b: "Obey the ruling" 
 jewish_events.10.t: "A State Within a State"
 jewish_events.10.d: "Our deference to the new commandments outlined by Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName]'s Bull has been echoed by Jews across Europe. Confined to their own quarters of each city, stripped of many of their civil rights and forced to publicly identify themselves as Jews, the divide between Jews and Christians in society has never been deeper."
 jewish_events.10.a: "This is how things will be"
 jewish_events.11.t: "An Unenforceable Bull"
 jewish_events.11.d: "Most Papal Bulls are more juridical ideals than actual effectice promulgations of law. Even Catholic rulers often flat-out ignored them, requiring the same rulings to be re-issued over and over again. This latest Bull from Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName], after causing such a stir, has ultimately proven to be no different.\nThough some Jews have separated themselves more distinctly from their Christian compatriots, this if anything may reduce the ethnic tensions and pogroms that periodically flair up."
 jewish_events.11.a: "Good"
 jewish_events.12.t: "The Jewish Reaction"
 jewish_events.12.d: "Our sported defiance of Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName]'s ignoble Bull and letters from leading Jewish scholars reminding him of his predecessors' declarations of protections for Jews has caused the self-described 'Holy Father' to falter, and less radical elements of the Vatican have arranged for another Bull to be issued repealing Cum Nimis Absurdum at the very least within our realm. We can only hope the broader Jewish community is freed from its damaging prescriptions."
 jewish_events.12.a: "Wonderful!"
 jewish_events.13.t: "Isaac Luria"
 jewish_events.13.d: "A mystical Levantine Rabbi named Yitzhak ben Shlomo Lurya has caused quite a stir in the Ottoman Empire and in turn the Jews of Europe. Isaac discovered a newly-compiled book on obscure mystical traditions called the Zohar, and internalized its teachings to the point where he became a respected ascetic. The mystical teachings contained within the Zohar are known as Kabbalah, and they have now exploded in popularity among the Jewish masses due to Isaac's profound influence and the respect he commands. Numerology, sigils, gnosis... once-strange concepts are now being discussed by Jews everywhere."
 jewish_events.13.a: "We must reject such superstitions"
 jewish_events.13.b: "Learn more of these divine mysteries" 
 jewish_events.14.t: "Ein Sof"
 jewish_events.14.d: "Like the ancient Neoplatonists, Kabbalah teaches that the essence of God is 'Ein Sof', 'The Infinite'. This elementary force was present, if such a term can be used, before even the creation of the spiritual realm. It withdrew from itself in an act known to Kabbalists as Tzimtzum to create the template for existence, and through it all things thus derive their own existence."
 jewish_events.14.a: "This sounds like nonsense"
 jewish_events.14.b: "A compelling teaching" 
 jewish_events.15.t: "Christian Kabbalah"
 jewish_events.15.d: "Just as the Christians stole our religion's teachings to create their own, they have been quick to co-opt this new Kabbalistic movement into a Christian framework. Various Renaissance scholars have linked concepts in Kabbalah to Christian doctrines like the Trinity and the supposed resurrection of Ieshua, and have integrated Kabbalah into their native occultist fantasies.\nEvery week new Christian occultists show up in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] looking for books to purchase or teachers to learn from."
 jewish_events.15.a: "Turn them away"
 jewish_events.15.b: "Embrace the syncretism" 
 jewish_events.16.t: "Kabbalah Takes Root"
 jewish_events.16.d: "Though many in our [Root.GovernmentName] had doubts about Kabbalah, its popularity among the masses and even high officials is unquestionable. By continually showing interest in it, we have emboldened its presence in Europe, essentially integrating it as a fundamental aspect of Jewish culture and identity."
 jewish_events.16.a: "It seems it is here to stay"
 jewish_events.17.t: "A Shared Tradition"
 jewish_events.17.d: "Kabbalah has been met with a mixed reception in our realm. Its popularity not only with Jews but also with Christians of various denominations has been an unexpected side-effect of this whole ordeal, in a way providing a point of shared cultural consciousness across the religious divide."
 jewish_events.17.a: "An interesting development"
 jewish_events.18.t: "The Fad Passes"
 jewish_events.18.d: "We all knew deep down that the veneration of Isaac Luria and his teachings would be a fad, and its end has finally come in [Root.GetName]. The obsession with silly occult rituals and magic has passed like many movements before it, leaving us in the cultural sphere of Europe where we belong instead of that of the Ottoman Empire."
 jewish_events.18.a: "So be it"
 jewish_events.19.t: "Court Jews and Banking"
 jewish_events.19.d: "Nobody wants to take the risk of giving loans without charging interest, and since Christians were forbidden from practicing usury this left the job of moneylending to Jews. Having been barred from many other professions, Jews naturally became prominent figures in Europe's banking scene, forming various elite banking families.\nThough Christians have gradually stopped enforcing their usury ban, Jewish financial expertise is highly sought after, particularly by German lords. This has led to a new phenomenon of 'Court Jews', Jews who handle a Christian monarch's finances in return for social prestige and other rewards. Figures like Aaron of Lincoln and Vivelin of Strasbourg have paved the way for Jews to earn a new level of respect within the Christian world."
 jewish_events.19.a: "We should look into this"
 jewish_events.19.b: "It's best not to get involved" 
 jewish_events.20.t: "Joseph Süß Oppenheimer"
 jewish_events.20.d: "One of the most prominent Court Jews in Europe is Joseph Süß Oppenheimer, an immensely wealthy banker in [court_jew_country.GetName] who has long supported the local nobility. However, the death of his last patron has caused a problem - his patron's successor, looking to evade the vast debts he owes to Oppenheimer, has conspired to fabricate criminal charges against him with the cooperation of corrupt authorities. The [court_jew_country.Monarch.GetTitle] has listed various charges including embezzlement, treason, and bribery, with the sentence being death.\nSome local Jews have tried to defend him, but others have corroborated the charges levelled against him. We may be his last hope in evading this unjust execution."

 jewish_events.20.b: "He knew what he was getting into with these Goyim"
 jewish_events.20.c: "Stage a jailbreak!"
 jewish_events.21.t: "An Independent Bank"
 jewish_events.21.d: "After the scandal around Oppenheimer, other Court Jews across Europe are making efforts to protect themselves from a similar fate. The most common strategy is to try to end their reliance on the largesse of individual rulers and instead establish independent Jewish banks. Several Court Jews including the famous Baron de Rothschild have reached out to [Root.GetName] looking for support in their endeavors, promising a return on the investment if we help them out."
 jewish_events.21.a: "Invest"
 jewish_events.21.b: "They should stay in their Christian courts"
 jewish_events.21.c: "They were foolish to ever get involved"
 jewish_events.22.t: "Banking Collapse"
 jewish_events.22.d: "With our repeated refusal to support the Court Jews and their forays into Christian high society, the Banking sector around our realm has largely collapsed, and Jews have returned to more traditional jobs such as mercantile sales. With this development, it would seem the trend of Jewish upward mobility in Christian Europe has been dealt a severe blow."
 jewish_events.22.a: "So it goes"
 jewish_events.23.t: "The Evolution of Jewish Banking"
 jewish_events.23.d: "Though the trend of 'Court Jews' has seen a downturn, many Jews have chosen to remain in the banking profession under their own full-fledged banks, keeping them in the same company as Christian families like the Medici and the Fuggers. It is hard to say what exactly this has accomplished in terms of relations between our two faiths."
 jewish_events.23.a: "Only time will tell"
 jewish_events.24.t: "Status Quo Preserved"
 jewish_events.24.d: "Our defense of Court Jews has been an inspiration across Europe, and even though some Court Jews met unfortunate ends, most remain confident in their line of work and their integration into Christian courtly life. If anything, our commitment to supporting them may prevent future Jewish financiers from suffering the same fate as those before them."
 jewish_events.24.a: "Good"
 jewish_events.25.t: "The Conversion of Jakob Frank"
 jewish_events.25.d: "Strange news has come to us from Poland. In past decades, a cult leader named Sabbatai Zevi declared himself the Messiah and somehow amassed a cadre of followers within the Ottoman Empire, immediately raising the concern of traditional Jewish leaders and the Sultan. On pain of death, Sabbatai was forced to convert to Islam publicly in Constantinople.\nDespite this clear collapse of Sabbatai's Messianic claims, a Polish disciple named Jakob Frank took up the same cause and in turn declared himself the reincarnation of Sabbatai, once again gathering a large following and once again be summoned to court by the local King. He too apostasized, converting to Roman Catholicism and demanding all his followers do the same with the understanding that the End Times are near. Many Jews who fell for his fraud have followed suit and have embraced Christianity."
 jewish_events.25.a: "We must crush this movement at all costs"
 jewish_events.25.b: "Let these schismatics do as they wish" 
 jewish_events.26.t: "The Emden-Eybeschutz Controversy"
 jewish_events.26.d: "Against all expectations, the Sabbatai incident has had a profound effect right here in Central Europe. A prominent German Rabbi, Jacob Emden, and a prominent Czech Rabbi, Jonathan Eybeschutz, have stirred up a great controversy that is shaking European Jews to the core. Emden has accused Eybeschutz of being in possession of secret amulets which reveal him to be a closeted Sabbatean and in turn declared him 'herem'.\nEybeschutz utterly rejects the accusation with the support of most Rabbis in Eastern Europe, and has asked for input from Jewish scholars across the continent, including the legendary Yechezkel Landau and Vilna Gaon.\nHow should our own scholars weigh in on the controversy?"
 jewish_events.26.a: "Support Emden"
 jewish_events.26.b: "Support Eybeschutz" 
 jewish_events.27.t: "Frankists in [Root.GetName]"
 jewish_events.27.d: "Rumors have come to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that a growing community of Frankists lives within our very nation and that its expansion has been rapid. These Frankists essentially practice a Jewish-Christian syncretic faith, and assert extremely radical view like antinomianism, contending that all laws of the Tanakh have been abrogated. They are Christians in all but name!"
 jewish_events.27.a: "Wipe them out"
 jewish_events.27.b: "Their beliefs sound compelling..." 
 jewish_events.28.t: "The Death of Sabbateanism"
 jewish_events.28.d: "Under unrelenting assault from Europe's Rabbis and secular Jewish leaders, the heresy of Sabbatai has been effectively wiped out. The radical followers of Sabbatai and Frank have finally been convinced of the error of their ways and been forced to do penance for ever having recognized them as the Messiah, and the tide of conversions to Christianity has been thankfully stemmed."
 jewish_events.28.a: "Good riddance"
 jewish_events.29.t: "Sabbateans Go Underground"
 jewish_events.29.d: "Our reaction to these new Messianic movements in our nation have not quite wiped them out entirely, but have at least made their followers profess their beliefs in secret. To some extent their strange and schismatic ideology may still infect Judaic thought, but this should at least put an end to the mass conversions that were going on under Frank's regime of lies."
 jewish_events.29.a: "A concerning development"
 jewish_events.30.t: "Sabbateanism Takes Hold"
 jewish_events.30.d: "Many in our [Root.GovernmentName] have seen the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s reaction to Sabbateanism as an implicit endorsement, and Sabbateans are now more numerous than ever. Their unique, Christian-aligned understanding of Judaism may be a major milestone in the reconciliation of our two faiths."
 jewish_events.30.a: "We live in strange times"
 jewish_events.31.t: "The Hasidim-Misnagdim Schism"
 jewish_events.31.d: "Every religion experiences schisms over time, and Judaism is currently embroiled in a severe one. A Rabbi from the Pale of Settlement named Israel ben Eliezer has proposed a new brand of Jewish orthodoxy, influenced by Lurianic Kabbalah, which advocates a return to lost traditions and the separation of Jews from Christian society to the degree that it is possible.\nThe Misnagdim are a broad coalition united against the Hasidim, linking it to past Messianic movements and emphasizing Talmudic scholarship over Kabbalah. Many of the institutional Rabbis in our own realm, fearing the rise of Hasidic Judaism, have encouraged us to take efforts to suppress it."
 jewish_events.31.a: "Support the Misnagdim"
 jewish_events.31.b: "Support the Hasidim" 
 jewish_events.32.t: "Public Destruction of Hasidic Texts"
 jewish_events.32.d: "Led by Misnagdim Rabbis, certain 'festivals' have been held in public squares in which early Hasidic texts are ripped apart and denounced. The Misnagdim Rabbis, with the support of some of Europe's leading Jewish scholars, have issued excommunications against all Jews professing Hasidic beliefs.\nSome of those belligerent actions have unsurprisingly caused social unrest around the realm, and are threatening to boil over into open violence."
 jewish_events.32.a: "Ban the festivals"
 jewish_events.32.b: "Take no stance"
 jewish_events.32.c: "Endorse the festivals"
 jewish_events.33.t: "Shtreimel and Sheitel"
 jewish_events.33.d: "The commitment of the Hasidim to ultra-Orthodox theology has caused them to embrace a series of distinct clothes, such as large the male 'shtreimel' hat and the female 'sheitel' wig meant to cover the hair. In addition to this gear, Hasidic Jews also wear frocks called 'rekels'.\nThese elaborate clothes make Hasidim stand out strongly from the general population, and in effect serve the same purpose as the golden hats and kerchiefs that anti-Jewish rulers wanted Jews to wear at all times."
 jewish_events.33.a: "Condemn these clothes"
 jewish_events.33.b: "Permit them" 
 jewish_events.34.t: "Hasidim Prevail in [Root.GetName]"
 jewish_events.34.d: "Due to our general support of the Hasidim in this emergent schism, they have essentially won out over the Misnadim in the region. In [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Jews can be seen wearing Hasidic garb on every street, and their Orthodox ideals have spread through all levels of society."
 jewish_events.34.a: "This changes everything"
 jewish_events.35.t: "A Permanent Schism?"
 jewish_events.35.d: "It is clear now that after years of back-and-forth the schism between the Hasidim and Misnagdim will not be resolved anytime soon. The Jewish community is now split between those who endorse traditional Jewish practices and those who embrace revived Orthodox teachings."
 jewish_events.35.a: "It's a fait accompli now"
 jewish_events.36.t: "Misnagdim Prevail in [Root.GetName]"
 jewish_events.36.d: "The puported innovations of the Hasidim have largely been suppressed due to our support of Misnagdic principles. Like many reformist trends before them, the Hasidim will pass into the annals of history within our nation. Without their stifling restrictions, we will be freer in our interactions with the Christians of Europe."
 jewish_events.36.a: "This changes everything"
 jewish_events.37.t: "The Jewish Enlightenment"
 jewish_events.37.d: "Jewish thinkers seem to be no less interested in Enlightenment ideology than Christian ones. As far back as the seventeenth century Baruch Spinoza changed the landscape of European philosophy forever with his advocation of Rationalism.\nOf course, Baruch was excommunicated from the local Jewish community for his heretical views by age 23. History may repeat itself with this new generation of Jewish intellectuals who lie at the core of the 'Haskalah' movement - the Jewish Enlightenment. These free thinkers are trying to revive Hebrew as a living language and some encourage our total integration with European society at large, while at the same time others wish to promote and cherish our unique Jewish identity.\nThere are, of course, many such divisions within the movement as different intellectuals promote different degrees of change."
 jewish_events.37.a: "Side with the assimilationists"
 jewish_events.37.b: "Side with the moderates" 
 jewish_events.37.c: "Side with the traditionalists"
 jewish_events.38.t: "The Hebrew Language"
 jewish_events.38.d: "The Enlightenment teaches that language is an integral part of every culture and its cohesive identity. This has prompted many Jewish intellectuals to advocate for a gradual revival of the Hebrew language for secular purposes, over a millennium after its demise as a spoken tongue. They have started by translating major European works into Hebrew and disseminating Hebrew newspapers for those who learn the language fluently to read.\nInevitably, these works have made it into our realm and into our court."
 jewish_events.38.a: "This is all too confusing"
 jewish_events.38.b: "Promote Hebraic literature"
 jewish_events.39.t: "Moses Mendelssohn"
 jewish_events.39.d: "Nobody can claim a greater place in the Jewish Enlightenment than Moses Mendelssohn, who rose from humble origins in Anhalt to become a rich textile trader and a leading writer and philosopher of this intellectual revival we are currently undergoing.\nThough Mendelssohn has at times been plagued by controversy over supposed Spinozist connections, it would be a great prestige to invite him to our court and hear his wise words in person."
 jewish_events.39.a: "He's a heretic"
 jewish_events.39.b: "Hire him!" 
 jewish_events.40.t: "Reactionary Rabbis"
 jewish_events.40.d: "The spurning of the Jewish Enlightenment within our nation has strangled it in its cradle, as the saying goes. The traditionalist Rabbis who feared their loss of power under this new intellectual regime have been vindicated and the movement has been exposed as just another passing fad of Christian-Jewish cross pollination."
 jewish_events.40.a: "It was fated"
 jewish_events.41.t: "A New Intellectual Landscape"
 jewish_events.41.d: "Though the Jewish Enlightenment has not accomplished as much as some of the radical reformers had hoped, it has still reshaped Jewish society in Europe to a degree. In the end, our relationship with other Enlightenment figures outside of the Jewish tradition has not been fundamentally changed."
 jewish_events.41.a: "Predictable"
 jewish_events.42.t: "Radical Assimilation"
 jewish_events.42.d: "Our support for the most extreme branches of the Jewish Enlightenment has led to the victory of the radical assimilationists within our nation, promoting a near-total embracement of the broad European identity in lieu of our distinct and separate Jewish identity. Jewish-Christian relations may never be the same after this."
 jewish_events.42.a: "This changes everything"
 jewish_events.43.t: "Jews in the [imperial_country.GetAdjectiveCap] [imperial_country.GovernmentName]"
 jewish_events.43.d: "Now that much of central Europe has been united under the banner of [imperial_country.GetName], a new epoch in European history seems to have been inaugurated - an epoch of unitary nation-states instead of fragmented feudal holdings owned as the personal property of minor lords.\nWith new unity powers comes new privileges for the Jewish people, but also new threats. Benevolent rulers have in the past granted sweeping civil rights to Jews and allowed them to publicly express themselves in ways they never could have before, but if a nation like [imperial_country.GetName] were ever to come under the control of anti-semitic Christians, we could face an unstoppable centralized power with no avenue of escape as in previous pogroms and expulsions."
 jewish_events.43.a: "Let Jews live proudly!"
 jewish_events.43.b: "Don't focus on our faith" 
 jewish_events.44.t: "[imperial_country.Monarch.GetName]ic Code"
 jewish_events.44.d: "In drafting a new constitution for [imperial_country.GetName], [imperial_country.Monarch.GetTitle] [imperial_country.Monarch.GetName] must choose how to address the role of Jews in society. It is fashionable now to have a complete separation of church and state, which may have its benefits, but at the same time giving specific provisos for the relationship between the Jewish people and the [imperial_country.GetAdjectiveCap] government could ensure that rights are never trampled on."
 jewish_events.44.a: "Keep them separate"
 jewish_events.44.b: "There should surely be provisos" 
 jewish_events.45.t: "Hep-Hep Riots"
 jewish_events.45.d: "The increasingly public presence of Jews in European society has led to a resurgence of bitterness among European Christians. Once again the problem of pogroms has reared its ugly head, as rabble-rousers have warned that Jews will soon be taking over all of Europe's wealth at the expense of Christianity. The confusing transition from civic and comital laws to the laws of a unified authority has added to the anger and chaos.\nViolent anti-Jewish riots have started breaking out in cities across [imperial_country.GetName], and the armed forces can barely keep them under control."
 jewish_events.45.a: "Send whatever we can to help end the riots!"
 jewish_events.45.b: "These are natural growing pains" 
 jewish_events.45.c: "Maybe it was a mistake to ever change those laws"
 jewish_events.46.t: "Reforms Repealed"
 jewish_events.46.d: "Our agitation against the legal reforms that were floated to improve the position of Jews in Europe has led to something of a falling out. Most traditional conventions have been put back in place, ensuring a stark separation between Christians and Jews will continue through the age of nationalism."
 jewish_events.46.a: "Unsurprising"
 jewish_events.47.t: "An Uneasy Settlement"
 jewish_events.47.d: "There is no clear answer to the role that the Jewish people will play in this new era of nation-states with constructed national identities that transcend religion. It would seem that the status of the Jews has ultimately not changed much at all from what it was like during the most decentralized periods of the Holy Roman Empire."
 jewish_events.47.a: "This is natural"
 jewish_events.48.t: "Jewish Rights Confirmed"
 jewish_events.48.d: "Not only have the recent legal reforms in Europe improved the rights of European Jews, they have also led to the creation of regional Jewish congresses that can represent the interests of the Jews on a broader and collective scale. We must wield this newfound power wisely if we are to maintain our position within this continent."
