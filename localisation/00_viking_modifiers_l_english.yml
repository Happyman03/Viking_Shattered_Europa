Robert Bruce employed the hobby for his guerilla warfare and mounted raids, covering 60 to 70 miles (100 to 110 km) a day. Within Ireland and Britain (and beyond), they were well-known and highly valued. Edward I was much impressed by the abilities of the Irish hobelar, resulting in extensive use of them in Scotland, even procuring six of them from the Decies for his own personal use."

 cavalry_tech_19: "Yeomanry"
 cavalry_tech_19DESCR: "To improve the country's defences, volunteer regiments were raised in many counties from yeomen. While the word 'yeoman' in normal use meant a small farmer who owned his land, Yeomanry officers were drawn from the nobility or the landed gentry, and many of the men were the officers' tenants or had other forms of obligation to the officers. At its formation, the force was referred to as the Yeomanry Cavalry. Members of the yeomanry were not obliged to serve overseas without their individual consent."
 cavalry_tech_24: "Guards"
 cavalry_tech_24DESCR: "The regiment was formed by the amalgamation of two other regiments: The Dragoons and the Yeomanry. The Guards have served in a variety of roles and theatres since its formation. Historically guards were flexible soldiers, who fought on and alongside their mounts. The regiment maintains a traditional structure, with squadrons and units for deployment and active duty, training, ceremony, cadets, and administration."
