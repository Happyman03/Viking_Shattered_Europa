We cannot allow this fate to emerge from the depths of the Aegean, lest all that we have built sink unto it. It is clear now that Venice cannot defend our sovereignty, thus we must ensure our own safety through a hardy militia and barreling fleet."
 NAX_fallback_islands_title: "Fallback Islands"

We should seek support elsewhere."
 NAX_strike_out_title: "Strike Out"
 NAX_strike_out_desc: "No more shall we live in fear of the Turks. With the help of our allies, we have become mighty and full of vigor and vitality. Confidence grows by the day of our resiliance, for this is but another crusade, the likes of which were the very origins of our grand duchy."

 NAX_lordship_of_negroponte_desc: "Our longtime influencers, the Venetians, will perhaps miss us, but we shan't let them forget us. The Triarchy of Negroponte, our dutiful neighbor and fellow crusader state, is perhaps even more influenced by Venice than us. We cannot let the honorable Aegean Archipelago fall to such foreign influence. We must liberate our brethren!"
 NAX_wandering_hospitaller_title: "Wandering Hospitaller"
 NAX_wandering_hospitaller_desc: "Long have the Knights of St. John marched, from Jerusalem, to Tripoli, then to Cyprus, finally to end up at Rhodes.

 NAX_lordship_of_chios_desc: "Among the decentralized archipelagos of the Aegean, Chios is perhaps in the most dangerous position, with limited resources save wine, and limited protection in the face of Turkic naval supremacy.

We should bring them into our growing archipelago to ensure their safety as well as ours."
 NAX_vineyards_of_the_aegean_title: "Vineyards of the Aegean"

The Canadian identity was founded from all of the above: mutual trauma, two conflicting dominant languages, founded by the geography of our lands, founded by sport and finally our innovations in cuisine. Other ways that people bonded and created cultures was through the invention of unique foods, national sports and games—most specifically on how regions of a country developed their own food.\nFrom once simply being an offshoot of the cultures of the settlers of old, a new identity evolved over the years that unified the Canadian people.\n\nEarly on, Lower Canada adopted traditional tactics of the First Peoples regarding the common maple tree and produced maple syrup, which quickly gained traction among the populace. Montréal developed unique ways to smoke meat and is now renowned for such; within the small towns outside Québéc City came the invention of a dish made from thinly-cut potatoes—following the new phenomenon known by the Belgians as "frieten", but more commonly known as fries—covered in a layer of gravy and then a layer of cheese curds. This popular Québécois dish became syonymous with the region's gastronomy and was eventually dubbed 'poutine'. Moving on, the butter tart came from Upper Canada, and in Niagara came fine wine. All throughout Canada came the maple taffy, and later even more and more sweets came. Cuisine united us together with an identity—finally something for our citizens of all backgrounds to bond over—something to identify with together as Canadians."

 ME_Canada_Events.12.D: "As seen throughout history, people form cultures through bonds that develop in a variety of ways—from possible shared hardships to the language they speak to even the geography of the land. The Canadian identity was founded from all of the above: mutual trauma, two conflicting dominant languages, founded by the geography of our lands, founded by sport and finally our innovations in cuisine. Other ways that people bonded and created cultures was through the invention of unique foods, national sports and games—most specifically on how regions of a country developed their own food.\nFrom once simply being an offshoot of the cultures of the settlers of old, a new identity evolved over the years that unified the Canadian people.\n\nEarly on, Lower Canada adopted traditional tactics of the First Peoples regarding the common maple tree and produced maple syrup, which quickly gained traction among the populace. Montréal developed unique ways to smoke meat and is now renowned for such; within the small towns outside Québéc City came the invention of a dish made from thinly-cut potatoes—following the new phenomenon known by the Belgians as \"frieten\", but more commonly known as fries—covered in a layer of gravy and then a layer of cheese curds. This popular Québécois dish became syonymous with the region's gastronomy and was eventually dubbed 'poutine'. Moving on, the butter tart came from Upper Canada, and in Niagara came fine wine. All throughout Canada came the maple taffy, and later even more and more sweets came. Cuisine united us together with an identity—finally something for our citizens of all backgrounds to bond over—something to identify with together as Canadians."

Many settlers and frontiersmen have repeatedly asked for government assistance in clearing out the native tribes or moving these tribes to new locations, but the church has requested that we shall stray away from outright removal; for if we were to educate them instead, they might help boost our population while being good Christian Canadians. \nWe must choose now to educate them, or militarily deal with them in order to remove them as a threat."

 ME_Canada_Events.42.OPT2: "Perhaps we can discuss a compromise"
 ME_Canada_Events.42.OPT3: "I SAID PUT! THEM! DOWN"

 ME_Canada_Events.43.T: "An Emerging Culture of Quebec"
 ME_Canada_Events.43.D: "As time goes by the ties between the our former homeland,  and our home in the colonies grow weaker. The settlers in around the Saint Lawrence, in Lower Canada barely associate themselves with their ancestral home any more. They now prefer to think of themselves as the Québécois, and this sentiment is beginning to spread throughout all of Quebec."
 ME_Canada_Events.43.OPT1: "Oh?"

 ME_Canada_Events.44.T: "The Expeditions"
 ME_Canada_Events.44.D: "As we venture into the unknown, influential people in the colonies have exclaimed that if there indeed is a second ocean navigable by sailing around far the now named Cape Horn, then there MUST be a way directly westwards across the plains of far. \nAn expedition has massive risks and chances at failure, but should such  expedition could bring us years of prestige, and economic fortune upon succeeding."
 ME_Canada_Events.44.OPT1: "We shall learn more of our Terrain, Perhaps a River connects the way anyways?"

 ME_Canada_Events.45.T: "Preparations for the Frontiers"
 ME_Canada_Events.45.D: "\"Just an update for the expedition, Sir - i can now confirm a list of Men, horses for the company, we've also accumulated what we personally believe to be the perfect amount of food and other supplies to fit your previous demands, you may request more if you'd like - we can never over prepare, can we?\""
 ME_Canada_Events.45.OPT1: "Lets prepare the men with more Food and Supplies"
 ME_Canada_Events.45.OPT2: "I place my trust in you, if you believe it's enough then so be it."
 ME_Canada_Events.45.OPT3: "You.....you know what? Expeditions cost more then i thought."

 ME_Canada_Events.46.T: "Leaving Fort York"
 ME_Canada_Events.46.D: "As our men gather in Fort York, ready for months of travel ahead, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] makes a speech to the Expeditionary Party and surrounding people, he delivers a message of hope and courage and wishes the group farewell. \nPrivately meeting with the leader of the expedition, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] discusses routes across the Niagara Falls or routes across Northern Ontario ending with a general consensus on travelling through the Canadian North, before [Root.Monarch.GetName] bids his final goodbye the captain asks [Root.Monarch.GetName] if he was up for the task - if he wanted to join the expedition."
 ME_Canada_Events.46.OPT1: "Let our [Root.Monarch.GetName] join the expedition"
 ME_Canada_Events.46.OPT2: "We shall send our heir in our place"
 ME_Canada_Events.46.OPT3: "We shall send them off and await results"

 ME_Canada_Events.47.T: "Thunder Bay"
 ME_Canada_Events.47.D: "Our expedition has reached what the travellers are calling "Thunder Bay", named after the thunderous sounds of the nearby bay of water. They had used this area to rest for a week and claim this might be a perfect location for a future settlement."
 ME_Canada_Events.47.OPT1: "Only good can come from this!"

 ME_Canada_Events.48.T: "Lake of the Woods"
 ME_Canada_Events.48.D: "After a month and a half of trekking the expeditionary force through the extremely strong rock of the northern half of Ontario, known mow as the Canadian Shield - our party had thought they had gotten past the worst of it, that was the case until they came across miles of dense forest many concealing lakes and rivers beneath the large thick leaves of the trees. \nDebates between the party have arisen for possible solutions to the issue, including trying to find a way - going around or attempting to ford then portage the way across."
 ME_Canada_Events.48.OPT1: "Ford and portage across"
 ME_Canada_Events.48.OPT2: "Stay safe and try to find another way around."

 ME_Canada_Events.49.T: "Fort Winnipeg"
 ME_Canada_Events.49.D: "Once finally making it our of the Lake of the Woods and the far sights of Northen Ontario fade, our party of adventurers gave come across a massive open plain for absolute miles, to prevent the risk of being trapped in the plain without supplies, some scouts had found a wondrous spot for a small fort - dubbing the fort along the Red River as the \"Gateway to the West\"."
 ME_Canada_Events.49.OPT1: "Only good can come from this!"

 ME_Canada_Events.50.T: "Fort Pelley"
 ME_Canada_Events.50.D: "It had been a long while since leaving Winnipeg, since leaving 'Gateway West'. Once the last sights of Ontario faded, our expeditionary party was met with what one of the men described as "Nothing". Nothing for miles upon miles, nothing for days and weeks; they had found the "Land of Nothing". For that wasn't a lie, the land of a flat field of grass, a land so flat you could see people days away. If it were not for the roaming Buffalo, it's safe to say the party would have starved to death. In knowing that truth, they have founded "Fort Pelley" so no poor traveller would face the same in the future."
 ME_Canada_Events.50.OPT1: "Thank god for the buffalo."

 ME_Canada_Events.51.T: "Mountains Ahead"
 ME_Canada_Events.51.D: "Called one of the men scouting ahead on the expedition, this news had been a great sign of relief for almost everyone involved on the journey, one man exclaimed, "If I had to see land as flat as Pelley again, I'd rather die!". The mountains were not only signs of hope but by the day a growing concern of worry, closer and closer the mere size of these mountains dawned on the group. Finally setting up camp just under a day's away under the mountain, they would lay the foundations for a Fort Calgary before deciding the next path forward."
 ME_Canada_Events.51.OPT1: "Those....Those mountains are very....Large?"

 ME_Canada_Events.52.T: "Mountain Problems"
 ME_Canada_Events.52.D: "The expedition was at a standstill, decisions needed to occur, hard truths needed to be swallowed, "We need to find a way across, around or over these mountains" said the Captian. That was the truth to be had, the expedition had to get past the largest obstacle in months, A rocky Mountain range stretching what seemed to be the edge of the continent. Having packed enough equipment and clothes to possibly survive winter if they ended trapped, many still worried if the clothes packed were quality enough to survive the cold heights of the enormous mountains ahead. \nThe debates had reached such a point of division that some parts of the group were threatening to split off and go their ways to find another way, at a point of such division, the decision lays on you."
 ME_Canada_Events.52.OPT1: "Mountain Ranges are many with valleys, let's find a way through."
 ME_Canada_Events.52.OPT2: "Let us travel around the mountain range to the north"
 ME_Canada_Events.52.OPT3: "Let us travel around the mountain range to the south"
 ME_Canada_Events.52.OPT4: "Why don't we blow our way through?"

 ME_Canada_Events.53.T: "Cariboo, British Columbia"
 ME_Canada_Events.53.D: "The expedition had reached the "top of the world", sights far and wide from the heights of the mountains, a sight better was the view of a huge ocean in the far distance - the location was surprisingly warm, had natural streams of water, a vast group of animals running throughout the valleys, lots of wood for building and had lots of ore for mining. \nWhile trekking through the valley, we came across a few natives who explained what they called the area, "Cariboo". Now whether they might have seen a reindeer and called it then or not, is yet to be discovered, all that matters is this is the perfect location for a mountain settlement, to help others in the future throughout the mountain range as well as make a profit on the ores in the ground."
 ME_Canada_Events.53.OPT1: "This is great!"

 ME_Canada_Events.54.T: "A Bridge Across"
 ME_Canada_Events.54.D: "What was surprising enough was when upon almost reaching the destination of the other ocean, the ocean our adventures had spent so many months expediting to get to; our scouts ahead had found a perfect worn dirt path and a bridge crossing a vastly wide and deep river, forward to a beach with a perfect position to settle, but upon closer inspection, a native tribe had approached them demanding a trade to use the path and bridge otherwise to ford down the river. \nSending a fluent Metis translator to discuss with the natives, they request close to a sum of 1000 ducats of gold to use in temples and ceremonies, that is the only allowed trade offer."
 ME_Canada_Events.54.OPT1: "KILL THEM! Force our way across!"
 ME_Canada_Events.54.OPT2: "Pay them and lets safely cross."
 ME_Canada_Events.54.OPT3: "We have no choice but to ford the river."

 ME_Canada_Events.55.T: "Pacific Ocean"
 ME_Canada_Events.55.D: "News had spread fast, the first successful expedition across the continent of North America has been achieved, nonetheless an expedition by our great nation. \nThis will be remembered for years to come and will bring great innovations to Canada to help us colonise these great discovered lands."
 ME_Canada_Events.55.OPT1: "Glory to Canada!"

 ME_Canada_Events.56.T: "The Failure of an Expedition." #Heir dies
 ME_Canada_Events.56.D: "After repeated disasters, many men and woman have been killed over time, hundreds of pounds of supplies or equipment have been lost and very few people are alive - if any at all, included in this vast number is our very own [Root.Heir.GetName], killed by a bad case of dysentery. \nThis will have lasting effects."

 ME_Canada_Events.57.T: "The Failure of an Expedition."
 ME_Canada_Events.57.D: "After repeated disasters, many men and woman have died, hundreds of pounds of supplies or equipment have been lost and very few people are alive - if any at all, this will have lasting effects."

 ME_Canada_Events.58.T: "A Pond Too Deep" #1
 ME_Canada_Events.58.D: "\"The worst-case possible has happened! In the attempt to ford the river, many wagons tipped over and many men all around rather drowned or died from the cold of the water, the surviving men have continued the journey after several failed attempts to recover the bodies.\""
 ME_Canada_Events.58.OPT1: "Oh Dear!"

 ME_Canada_Events.59.T: "A Long Way Around?" #2
 ME_Canada_Events.59.D: "Our men have ridden for miles around, seemingly unable to find the way around the lake, spending days in an attempt to get across. \nDuring this search for a way around, the expeditionary party has found a much safer position to ford the lake from, to which they safely achieved."
 ME_Canada_Events.59.OPT1: "Thank God."

 ME_Canada_Events.60.T: "Cold Days, Freezing Nights" #1
 ME_Canada_Events.60.D: "As our party ascends the mountains, the party quickly finds the path forward - but as nighttime quickly moves in, so does a blizzard. \nOver the next few hours many of the expedition fight for survival from the hard cold. \nMany members of our expedition would freeze and pass away due to the harsh weather, the rest would survive to morning and continue forward."
 ME_Canada_Events.60.OPT1: "Damn!"

 ME_Canada_Events.61.T: "A Range Too Long" #2
 ME_Canada_Events.61.D: "After travelling along the base of the mountains for weeks northwards, our scouts and the rest of the party have found no sign of the mountain range ending, this has left many of the part demoralised as they have headed back to Fort Calgary to recoup and to try again later."
 ME_Canada_Events.61.OPT1: "Damn!"

 ME_Canada_Events.62.T: "A Wall to Your Right!" #3
 ME_Canada_Events.62.D: "After travelling along the base of the mountains for weeks southwards across valleys and rivers alike, our scouts and the rest of the party have found no sign of the mountain range ending, this has left many of the part demoralised as they have headed back to Fort Calgary to recoup and to try again later."
 ME_Canada_Events.62.OPT1: "Damn!"

 ME_Canada_Events.63.T: "Explosive Consequences" #4
 ME_Canada_Events.63.D: "When has dynamite not been the solution to everything? Upon the party blowing many holes through many mountain obstacles, it would become a mistake when the last one ignited, while bloody extremely cool to watch; the constant shaking of the mountain has caused an avalanche to occur quickly sweeping over half the company away under the massive thick snow. The remaining men head back to Fort Calgary to recoup."
 ME_Canada_Events.63.OPT1: "Explosives? Really?"

 ME_Canada_Events.64.T: "The Battle of the Bridge"
 ME_Canada_Events.64.D: "The fight towards the bridge was easy enough, but little did our troops know that the natives were expert archers hidden away in the hillsides, furthermore as our men approached the bridge and tried to rush across natives were seen cutting a rope which promptly made the bridge collapse tossing them into the white rocky rapids below. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had pushed forward in an attempt to cut down what seemed to be the chief, but was quickly shot down by an array of arrows. The rest of our men were trapped and defeated by the natives, who would go on to sacrifice them later that night."
 ME_Canada_Events.64.OPT1: "The death of a prestigious leader, the end of an expedition."

 ME_Canada_Events.65.T: "Did you do it?" #1
 ME_Canada_Events.65.D: "With the makeshifts slowly pushing out to the rapids, going first was [Root.Monarch.GetName] who was accompanied by some men; His was the first of the wagons that were speedily thrown against sharp rocks by the strong force of water, others would crash into each other starting leaks drowning the wagons, a few final wagons in the back would manoeuvre back and forth between them making it to the destination. \nYou've made it but what did it cost?"
 ME_Canada_Events.65.OPT1: "Everything."

 ME_Canada_Events.66.T: "What's that sound?" #1
 ME_Canada_Events.66.D: "With the makeshifts slowly pushing out to the rapids, going first was [Root.Monarch.GetName] who was accompanied by some men; His was the first of the wagons that were speedily thrown against sharp rocks by the strong force of water, others would crash into each other starting leaks drowning the wagons, a few final wagons in the back would manoeuvre back and forth between the fallen and sinking boats, but in the heat of the moment while too focused on not hitting rocks, they forgot to stay to the left, and got dragged along a new bend in the river....leading to a waterfall."

 ME_Canada_Events.67.T: "The Failure of an Expedition."

 ME_Canada_Events.69.T: "Moose Attack"
 ME_Canada_Events.69.D: "It was a dark and cold night, the expeditionary party was camped along the outer parts of a forest, tents lining the thick and large trees. It was around midnight when the camp fell into chaos, a large pack of moose were attempting to transverse the camp when one was startled causing an attack on the camp, tossing aside men left and right and others trampling others inside the tents. \nIn the mist of this many lanterns had smashed off the ground leading to fires throughout the camp."
 ME_Canada_Events.69.OPT1: "Damn Animals!"

 ME_Canada_Events.70.T: "Murder Scene"
 ME_Canada_Events.70.D: "It is well known that this isn't the first expedition into the frontier, that many expeditions have gone deep into the unknown and failed to return; it would be today that our expeditionary party would find the result of the failed expeditions. \nThey have come across a mystery, they have come across an abandoned wagon, dead bodies scattered around. One thing is for certain, a dispute or a fight occurred; rather party members themselves in a brawl or an attack from a native tribe. \n"
 ME_Canada_Events.70.OPT1: "We should be careful around here."

 ME_Canada_Events.71.T: "River Crossing"
 ME_Canada_Events.71.D: "As your expeditionary party moves further into the unknown they have come across a unmapped river, the river is at a glance 260+ feet across and has a depth of well over 6 feet, the party has many options of crossing."

 ME_Canada_Events.72.T: "A River Too Deep"
 ME_Canada_Events.72.D: "As the party attempts to ford the river, the Oxen become scared causing chaos, tossing many caravan wagons into the water. Many men have drowned and much of the equipment has been lost. \nThe Rest of the men have made it across but at high cost to the expedition"
 ME_Canada_Events.72.OPT1: "Damn!"

 ME_Canada_Events.73.OPT1: "What a relief!"

 ME_Canada_Events.74.T: "Hunting misadventures"
 ME_Canada_Events.74.D: "Last night a pair of hunters in the expedition had fallen in an exposed entrance to a cavern, it had taken until this morning when other hunters found them. The hunters report claims that the cavern had an overabundance of ores and resource, a future well-placed mine or quarry could prove useful if they're claims are to be believed."
 ME_Canada_Events.74.OPT1: "This is fantastic news!"

 ME_Canada_Events.75.T: "Cholera outbreak in the expedition"
 ME_Canada_Events.75.D: "It happened fast, one day one adventurer in the expeditionary party fell quick with sickness before passing away; this would be worse if it had spre.....The sickness has broken out in the party infecting everyone. Many people are stuck and defecating everywhere, leading to many to die of the sickness."
 ME_Canada_Events.75.OPT1: "Damn!"

 ME_Canada_Events.76.T: "Stolen goods?"
 ME_Canada_Events.76.D: "It was early morning when members of the expedition had awoken to a disastrous sight, many different crates of goods and some other wagons were broken into and destroyed. With the members discussing between each other, it is now thought that this could not have been done by a bear or a wild animal, but to have been natives in the night."
 ME_Canada_Events.76.OPT1: "We should be more careful!"

 ME_Canada_Events.77.T: "Wonderous Valley"
 ME_Canada_Events.77.D: "As our men trekked over a steep incline, the last thing they were expecting to see was the most beautiful sight of their lives, a massive valley.

 ME_Canada_Events.80.D: "It was late at night, all but the drunkards around the fire were fast asleep within each other's respective tents, there was light rain - even that wasn't enough to put the drunkards to bed. From within the tents, many close to the campfire could hear clear as day an escalating situation outside. Two of the drunken members had decided to let anger get the better of them, starting from verbal insults to each other to the sounds of a person or two getting hit, to sounds of swords clashing.  This was until many heard the Captain yell to the erratic men to disperse and head to bed or face punishment. Within seconds two gunshots were heard, waking the entire camp, upon leaving the tent, many were surrounding a man on the ground...a flintlock in hand, and with a wound with a through the heart, It was the captain, and he was dead."

 ME_Canada_Events.81.T: "Strange Situations"
 ME_Canada_Events.81.D: "It was late at night, all but the drunkards around the fire were fast asleep within each other's respective tents, there was light rain - even that wasn't enough to put the drunkards to bed. You had awoken out of your tent to politely ask the drunks to finally settle down, and sleep but upon leaving your tent someone had quickly gagged you, placing a bag over your head, strangling you until unconscious..... \n\n.......In the day the people of the expedition had noticed the disappearance of [Root.Monarch.GetName], but it would be hours after searching when a tribe of natives had arrived to ransom you; in the best knowledge to translate between the expeditionary group and the natives holding [Root.Monarch.GetName], it would be known that it was the choice of cooperating with the natives or risk the life of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. \n\nThey demand 500 ducats or else...."

 ME_Canada_Events.83.OPT1: "So Poison it is?"

 ME_Canada_Events.84.T: "Getting higher then Strasbourg Cathedral"
 ME_Canada_Events.84.D: "Moments after biting into the fruit, the member who tried the fruit became visually sleepy before collapsing to the ground, at first men surrounded him thinking he was poisoned or worse - dead; that quickly passed as the man jumped back to his feet, stumbling around like a drunkard exclaiming gibberish while being generally incoherent. \nOver the next few hours, the man's mood seemed to change as frequently as an ocean wave rides in, after about 6 hours the effects of the fruit wore down. "
 ME_Canada_Events.84.OPT1: "At least it wasn't poisonous."
 ME_Canada_Events.84.OPT2: "Maybe we should grow more and start a business?"

 ME_Canada_Events.85.T: "Devious Fruits"

 ME_Ottoman_Events.1.d: "The Sultan Murad II, famed for the conquest of the Beyliks in Anatolia and the Kingdoms in the Balkans, led the Ottoman army to victory against the Christian Coalition at the Battle of Varna not long ago. It is said that he dismounted and fell to his knees and prayed mid-battle, something a legendary Caliph had done. The battle immediately turned in their favor. Murad II styled himself like this - a Ghazi King - strongly, as one meant to embody the virtues of an honest warrior. Despite that, he had grown tired of his nearly two decades of constant warfare, for he did not enjoy ruling from the throne or the responsibilities that went with it. He decided to abdicate the throne to his son, Mehmed II following the victory at Varna. Despite that he was only given short reprieve until a Janissary riot against Mehmed II had forced him to once again take the reins and lead again."

 # Missions:
 #1st column
 tex_rio_grandean_infrastructure_title: "Rio Grandean Infrastucture"
 tex_rio_grandean_infrastructure_desc: "The mighty heart of the Rio Grande and Galveston Bay are both the most mercantile regions of our nation and continue to fund our settlement of the plains and our development. However, the coast is still riddled with empty beaches that have not yet been converted into industrial buildings and commercial centers. For the continued prosperity of Texas, we should industralize the coast and monopolize our valuable coastline."
 tex_augment_rio_grande_title: "Augment the Rio Grande"
 tex_augment_rio_grande_desc: "Recently, our army's finest engineers have recommended that with relatively manageable building projects we can make the Rio Grande navigable for the majority of our southern border. With more ships sailing along the river, we can guarantee that trade in the area will flourish and that we can easily travel from El Paso to the Galveston Bay in no time."
 #2nd column
 tex_consolidate_authority_title: "Consolidate Authority"
 tex_consolidate_authority_desc: "We may stand tall, but the heavy burden we shoulder cannot remain, or the government shall collapse. We need to reassert authority over Texas before we fall to chaos."
 tex_native_destiny_title: "The Native Destiny"
 tex_native_destiny_desc: "The many Indian tribes that live in our settlements and raid our frontiers repel any settlements froms growing and they slaughter our innocent civillians. The best option for us is to either eradicate them or civilize them in the ways of our people."
 #2nd column Native
 tex_native_civilization_title: "Native Civilization"
 tex_native_civilization_desc: "No matter how barbaric the natives are, the best way to end this threat is through rehabilitation. We should build schools and universities and educate them in the ways of civilization."
 tex_caddoan_agreement_title: "Caddoan Agreement"
 tex_caddoan_agreement_desc: "The Caddoan Indians are one of the few tribes that are willing to agree to an armistice with us. We should probably take advantage of their gullibleness and strike a deal that will benefit us more than them."
 #2nd column Texan
 tex_exclusive_texas_title: "Only Texans in Texas"
 tex_exclusive_texas_desc: "Our lands are plagued by the savage Indians who massacre our civillians and ransack our frontier settlements. No longer will this treachery be tolerated. Texas is now for Texans and Texans only."
 tex_populate_frontier_desc: "All around us is empty land that is barely populated or simply populated by the savages. Therefore, we have legitimate right to colonize and populate these lands as we please. Onwards, with glory!"
 tex_populate_frontier_title: "Populate the Frontier"
 #3rd column
 tex_texas_texans_title: "Texas is for Texans"
 tex_texas_texans_desc: "Even though we own most of Texas, the native Texan population is small and most of the land is still filled with loyalists, natives, and other non-Texans. Even if we choose to accept these people as citizens, the lack of unity within Texas Proper is worrisome."
 tex_huasteca_expedition_title: "The Huasteca Expedition"
 tex_huasteca_expedition_desc: "The Indians of Mexico are even more barbarous than the troublesome ones in our northern and western frontiers. The more civilized small republics that attempt to consolidate power are all but stable and spillovers are common. Down south, they commit inhumane blood sacrifices and squabble with each other in primitive warfare. Because of constant struggles, they all have massive standing armies that threaten our dominance over the Rio Grande.  Thus, we should seize the coast for ourselves and prevent any irrelevant tribe or republic from pestering us any further."
 tex_mexican_heartland_title: "The Mexican Heartland"
 tex_mexican_heartland_desc: "The farther and farther we advance into Mexico, the more we realize just how potent the land is. Many areas are capable of rivaling even our Galveston Bay cities and can easily become major metropolitan centers. As it stands, these lands are filled with filthy European sympathizers, Indians, and independent warlords. Clearly, it would be much better off under our control where it can prosper and flourish unlike currently."
 tex_leech_european_trade_title: "Leech European Trade"
 tex_leech_european_trade_desc: "The scheming Europeans who once terrorized us still own significant shares in regional trade because of the Trade Companies they established years ago. However, we can no longer tolerate the Europeans controlling our trade from far away. Texan trade is for Texas only, and now it is time to turn the tables and begin leeching their trade."
 tex_mighty_lone_star_title: "The Mighty Lone Star"
 tex_mighty_lone_star_desc: "In the tough American world that we plunged ourselves into, our instability threatened to topple the nation for which Texans valiantly fought and died. Hostile enemies all around us and relatively barren terrain rendered us vulnerable internally and externally, but our cities continuously flourished and we expanded past the size of  a minor republic. Now, the mighty Lone Star stands tall above all others and we will continue to prosper henceforth."
 #4th column
 tex_texan_fortification_title: "Texan Fortifications"
 tex_texan_fortification_desc: "Despite our glorious revolution and secession from our tyrannical overlords, we find ourselves in a hostile world filled with enemies with not an ally in sight. We must bolster our defenses as to not fall to foreign hostility."
 tex_westward_expansion_title: "Westward Expansion"
 tex_westward_expansion_desc: "To our west are vast plains and deserts with spots of vegetation perfect for creating larger ranches to feed our ever-growing cattle population. After all, all that stands in our way are those pesky Indians and the scorching heat. Send them to the ranch!"
 tex_rein_wild_west_title: "Rein in the Wild West"
 tex_rein_wild_west_desc: "The western frontier is widely unpopulated and most settlements are very independent of our authority. In fact, these lands have gained a reputation for being the 'Wild West' because of its high concentration of outlaws, saloons, and hookers. However, the many criminals at large that occupy these lands resent our government and threaten our control over the region. It may not be high noon, but it is high time to bring the Wild West back under our sovereignty."
 tex_advance_pacific_title: "Advance to the Pacific"
 tex_advance_pacific_desc: "The land of California nestled between the Pacific and the Sierra Nevada Range is rumored to possess vast quantities of gold. However, these lands are underpopulated and only filled with imperialist filth and seldom any Indians. We should expand the frontier to the Pacific and seize these lands for ourselves."
 tex_california_gold_mine_title: "Californian Gold Mines"
 tex_california_gold_mine_desc: "Now that we have colonized the lands of California, we have managed to tap into the massive gold mines. Vast profits have been amassed, but the mining process is tedious and production is still on a small scale. We should invest more into the gold business and become major producers of the coveted metal of the sun."
 #5th column
 tex_texan_national_army_title: "Texan National Army"
 tex_texan_national_army_desc: "Regardless of size, the keys to a powerful military are morale, discipline, and organization. Whilst our men are proud to fight for the Texan cause, our army is in dire need of reform and our organization levels are but laughable. This oversight renders us vulnerable to any scheming Europeans or nearby freedom fighters who seek to conquer our lands. It is in our best interests to professionalize our army and organize it so that it can valiantly fight for our sake and secure victories time and time again."
 tex_texan_rangers_title: "Texan Rangers"
 tex_texan_rangers_desc: "Once the scourge of the frontier, we have realized that cowboys have more worth than we ever expected. Their skill in handling them steeds is immaculate and they can control them better than the Indians themselves. Although they may be unprofessional, they surely will help swell our ranks and allow for better cavalry combat. After all, what's a Texan without patriotism and love of the army?" 
 #Events:

 ME_Texas_Events.1.T: "The Establishment of Houston"
 ME_Texas_Events.1.D: "Strategically located at the junction between the Buffalo and White Oak Bayous, Houston was destined to be a burgeoning metropolis since investors first proposed the idea. Regionally, it is positioned at a central location among our coastal population centers, and the region is already extremely potent, albeit limited by rivers that we will either have to bridge over or veer away. The plains upon which the city was founded will be a historical landmark for the Texan people and be a testament to the mighty cities of the Texan nation."
 ME_Texas_Events.1.OPT1: "It will become the new capital of our nation."
 ME_Texas_Events.1.OPT2: "We lack the funds necessary for this."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.2.T: "The Wild West"
 ME_Texas_Events.2.D: "Compared to our major metropolitan area sprawled along the coast of Galveston Bay, our western frontier is barren and underpopulated. Most settlers are hookers, escaped fugitives, and those who seek to get away from our authority in the land of outlaws dubbed the 'Wild West'. The lands referred to as the Wild West are actually very potent and we believe that the mass flatlands can be utilized as grazing grounds and ranches. However, these criminals and cowboys despise our government and threaten our authority over our recent expansionist investment."
 ME_Texas_Events.2.OPT1: "Worrisome."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.3.T: "Future of the Natives"
 ME_Texas_Events.3.D: "For generations upon generations, Texas has been the ancestral homes of the barbarous Indians, who are not even worthy of being called a 'civilized' culture. Nevertheless, it has become the home of the Texans as well and many Indians refuse to acknolwedge our settlements of their lands and wage war on our nation. Many of them raid our new frontiers and no large settlements have arisen because of this. We must choose to educate them or exterminate them in order to eclipse them and remove them as a threat."
 ME_Texas_Events.3.OPT1: "Education is more ethical."
 ME_Texas_Events.3.OPT2: "They are savages beyond rehabilitation."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.4.T: "Gold Discovered in California!"
 ME_Texas_Events.4.D: "The rumors were true! Our miners have discovered pockets in gold in Northern California, with only some being found near the Sierra Nevada. News has spread all across the land that the vast gold mines rumored to be in California exist and now many prospectors have already arrived at our shores."
 ME_Texas_Events.4.OPT1: "Gee golly!"
 
 ME_Texas_Events.5.T: "The Lone Star Triumphant"
 ME_Texas_Events.5.D: "Once, we were looked down upon by the imperialist colonial powers as a weak secessionist movement within one of their many, many colonies. When we succeeded beyond all expectations, we were still nowhere near stable or powerful. We were but a small state surrounded by enemies and land open for settlements. Through the development of our cities and our expansion into the vast frontier, we have swelled to a new zenith, and the Lone Star has come out triumphant against all odds."
 ME_Texas_Events.5.OPT1: "Texas stands strong!"

 ME_Texas_Events.6.T: "An Offer from Texas"
 ME_Texas_Events.6.D: "Instead of attempt to eradicate us like all of the other European powers, these 'Texans' have been hospitable and they have made us eager to seek an agreement as soon as possible. Recently, an offer has arrived that lists the following: \n\nCaddo would become a vassal of Texas, however they will be treated as equals to the Texan citizens. \nCaddo will voluntarily migrate near the Texan borders in order to eliminate the distance between Texas and Caddo. \n\nWe see this as a valuable deal as it allows us to assimilate ourselves voluntarily without any form of bloodshed involved."
 ME_Texas_Events.6.OPT1: "This is the ideal method of  preserving our people without suffering."
 ME_Texas_Events.7.OPT2: "This is a power move hidden behind their superficial arms of hospitality."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.7.T: "Caddoan Agreement"
 ME_Texas_Events.7.D: "Our peaceful ambitions have finally been noticed. Believing our 'true' intentions, the Caddoans have agreed to become our vassals and have migrated to lands right next to our borders. However, we still have to uphold the promises we made in the offer. This means that the Caddoan natives will be treated as our citizens as long as the Caddoans rightfully remain our vassals."
 ME_Texas_Events.7.OPT1: "Great."
 
 ME_Texas_Events.8.T: "Caddoan Refusal"
 ME_Texas_Events.8.D: "Even after we opened our arms of hospitality to the Caddoans, they have foolishly refused our offer. Now, we can justify our conquests of the lands as they have rejected any peaceful offers of subjugation."
 ME_Texas_Events.8.OPT1: "Their loss, not ours."
