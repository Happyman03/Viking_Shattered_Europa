From the 3rd century bc onward their history is one of decline and disintegration, and with Julius Caesar’s conquest of Gaul (58–51 bc) Druidic independence came to an end on the European continent but the religion still florished behind closed doors. In Britain and Ireland this decline moved more slowly, but traditional religion was gradually eroded through the pressures of political subjugation; today the Druidic religion is spoken only on the western periphery of Europe, in restricted areas of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Brittany (in this last instance largely as a result of immigration from Britain from the 4th to the 7th century ad). It is not surprising, therefore, that the unsettled and uneven history of the Druids has affected the documentation of their culture and religion."

In some Mixtec origin stories, revered ancestors were viewed as having arisen from a particular sacred river and then proceeding to create the deities and forces of the earth.

 palmyrian: "Palmarian Catholic"
 palmyrian_religion_desc: "Four Spanish schoolgirls (only known as Ana, Josefa, Rafaela and Ana Maria) stated they saw an apparition of the Virgin Mary by a little tree on a piece of farmland called La Alcaparrosa near Palmar de Troya. The apparition became known as Our Lady of Palmar. Many people came to witness the supposed apparitions, and a number of miracles similar to those alleged to have happened at Fatima, Garabandal and Medugorje were said to have occurred. The seers had many supporters, including priests. As common in most traditionalist Catholic environments, the Palmarian Church displays a number of traditional devotions. The most important one is the Holy Penitential Rosary. Every Palmarian faithful has the obligation of praying the Penitential Rosary everyday; lay people generally pray it during the celebration of the turns of Masses inside the Palmarian Basilica."

 mariavite: "Mariavite"
 mariavite_religion_desc: "The Mariavite Church is today collectively known as Mariavites, who first emerged from the religious inspiration of Polish noblewomen. Initially, it was a renewal movement seeking reform in Polish Catholicism along with agreeing with many Orthodox Liturgies. The movement was an attempt to replicate the simplicity of the life of Mary, in Latin, qui Mariae vitam imitantur, (Let them imitate the Life of Mary), thus vita Mariae, the Life of Mary, gave the movement its name."

 basque_pagan_reformed: "Euskadi"
 basque_pagan_reformed_religion_desc: "One main figure of the Euskadi belief system was the female goddess Mari. According to legends collected in the area of Ataun, the other main figure was her consort Sugaar. However, due to the scarcity of the material, it is difficult to say if this would have been the "central pair" of the Basque pantheon. Based on the attributes ascribed to these mythological creatures, this would be considered a chthonic religion as all its characters dwell on earth or below it, with the sky seen mostly as an empty corridor through which the divinities pass"

 korean_pagan_reformed: "Muism"
 korean_pagan_reformed_religion_desc: "Central to Muism is the belief in many different gods, supernatural beings and ancestor worship. The mu are described as chosen persons. The mythology of Muism is orally recited during gut rituals. In Jeju, these are called bon-puri. Muism can be traced back to 1,000 BC. The religion has been part of the culture of the Korean Peninsula since then. Historically, Muism was an orally transmitted tradition that was mastered mainly by illiterate low-ranking women within the neo-Confucian hierarchy. However, several records and texts have documented the origin of Muism. One of these texts is Wei Shi which traces Muism to the third century. Evidently, the history of Muism remains a mystery. However, foreign religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism have influenced the development of Muism."
